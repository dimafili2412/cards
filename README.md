# General Info

Project by Dmitry Filipovich.
An assignment for a HackerU web dev class.

ReactJs
redux-toolkit
styled-components
material-ui icons
google-maps api

Decided to utilize styled componetns instead of css/scss because of the versatility it provides (themes, props)

## Scripts

Dev mode:
'npm start' in client dir
'npm run dev' in root dir
commands were split for convenient output using 2 terminals.
Prod mode:
'npm run prod' in root dir
Will build the client and run server in prod mode (cors)

Scripts are made for a windows machine - may not work on unix systems.

# Additional Info

The app exists solely to fulfill the criteria set by the assignment and does not represent an actual production app in any way or form.
The app follows most conventions but falls short in security and data management due to it being created without a database (assignment requirement)
The app also falls short in UX and logic due to page and functionality requirements from the assignment.
For actual production content I have created or collaborated in feel free to contact me on LinkedIn.
